## üöÄ Installation

The installation process is designed to be simple and robust.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iemafzal/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Run the Installer**:
    The main installation script will detect your OS, install all necessary dependencies using the appropriate package manager, and symlink the configuration files into place with `stow`.
    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
    ```

3.  **Restart Your Shell**:
    Once the installation is complete, restart your shell or source your `.zshrc` to apply the changes.

    Open Neovim (`nvim`) for the first time. Lazy.nvim will automatically install all the plugins.
